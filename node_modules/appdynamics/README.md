Introduction
===

AppDynamics’ Node.js agent allows you to monitor your Node.js applications in production so you get real-time visibility of server health, application performance, and resource metrics.

The causes of performance problems can be varied and complex to identify while the results usually boil down to a slow or unavailable web site. The AppDynamics Node.js agent reveals the internals of your application and infrastructure through Node.js process-level visibility and proactive monitoring using policies, enabling detailed analysis, fast troubleshooting, performance and capacity optimization. The agent’s process snapshots let you examine your code execution at a multi-process level so you can find the root cause of slow performance in minutes.


[Read our support matrix](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO42/Node.js+Supported+Environments) for details on the supported Node.js versions, operating systems, and backends. The supported environments are constantly being updated.

Requirements
--
To use the AppDynamics Node.js agent, you need the following:

-   An AppDynamics account with a running controller. [Sign up for an account here](https://portal.appdynamics.com/account/).
-   You will receive an email with your controller *host* and *port*.
- To download and install AppDynamics on your own, [download the controller from here](http://download.appdynamics.com/browse/zone/3/) and then [follow these instructions on how to install](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO42/Install+the+Controller).


Installing the Node.js agent
--
You can install the latest version by typing the following command from the root directory of the Node.js application that you are instrumenting:

```sh
npm install appdynamics
```

If you know which specific version of the Node.js agent you want to install, you can specify it:

```sh
npm install appdynamics@<version>
```
Then paste the following in your application  as the very first line of your application source code, before any other require statement:  

```sh
require("appdynamics").profile({
  controllerHostName: '<controller host name>',
  // If SSL, be sure to set controllerSslEnabled to true
  controllerPort: <controller port number>,
  controllerSslEnabled: false,
  // Required for a controller running in multi-tenant mode
  accountName: '<AppDynamics account name>',
  // Required for all 4.1+ controllers
  accountAccessKey: '<AppDynamics account key>',
  // App name (usually the name of your product)
  applicationName: 'app_name',
  // Tier name (e.g. the name of your Node.js app)
  tierName: 'tier_name',
  // Node name (e.g. the hostname of the machine)
  nodeName: 'node_name',
 });
```
